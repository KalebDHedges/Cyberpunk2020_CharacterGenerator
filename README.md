# Cyberpunk2020_CharacterGenerator
## Purpose
A simple console application that will be able to create full Cyberpunk2020 TTRPG characters.

Features will include:

**Base Character Requirements**:
- [ ] Name
- [ ] Role
- [ ] Gender
- [ ] Age
- [ ] Stats Block
- [ ] Skills Block
- [ ] Armor
- [ ] Cybernetics
- [ ] Weapons

**Lifepath Requirements**:
- [ ] Origins and Personal Style
- [ ] Family Background
- [ ] Motivations
- [ ] Life Events

**Extensions / Nice To Haves**:
- [ ] Name Libraries (Generate believable names for each ethnicity)
- [ ] Toggleable Fields (i.e. May want to create a character without armor/weapons)
- [ ] Matching Role to Stats (toggleable)
- [ ] Life Events Extensions (using DataFortress2020 - Interlock Unlimited - Character Gen)
- [ ] Generation Tree
  - Characters will generate names for NPC's required in the Life Events/Lifepath (Parents, Siblings, Lovers, Enemies, Etc...).
  - Allow the user to set a generation number (0, MAX).
  - For each character generated it will generate full qualified NPC's allowing you to quickly build a NPC "tree".
  - It will do this for each character until it reaches the Generation number. (MAX for dev purposes will be 2)
  - e.g. I run the character creation and it makes a NPC with a single parent, and a lover; it then goes on to fully develop the parent and the lover; then if the generation number is at 2 it will generate all NPC's required for their respective life events/lifepath's.

**EXTRA NICE TO HAVE**:
- [ ] Save generated NPC's into a formatted PDF document.
